# Release Notes

### [v0.17.1](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.1)

- **`completion` command** — generate shell tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, elvish, and powershell; redirect stdout to the appropriate file then reload your shell to activate (e.g. `longbridge completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_longbridge`)
- Sets `User-Agent: longbridge-cli/<version>` on all HTTP and WebSocket requests
- Adds `x-cli-cmd` request header identifying the active subcommand on every API call

### [v0.17.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.0)

- **`dca` command** — recurring investment plans: create, update, pause, resume, stop, view trade history, stats summary, check symbol eligibility, and calculate next trade date; HK/SG accounts must agree to Terms and Conditions before creating a plan (`--agree-terms` to skip the interactive prompt)
- **`sharelist` command** — community stock lists: list own and subscribed sharelists, browse trending lists (`popular`), create/delete sharelists, and add/remove/reorder constituent stocks
- **`short-positions`** — US stock short selling data: short ratio, short shares, average daily volume, days-to-cover, and close price; updated bi-monthly by FINRA; `--count` 1–100
- **`option volume`** — real-time call/put volume snapshot with put/call ratio; `daily` subcommand for historical call/put volume and open interest
- **`option chain`** — without `--date` now returns expiry dates only; pass `--date` to see strikes for a specific expiry
- **`profit-analysis`** — added `--start`/`--end` date filtering for the summary command; Simple Yield and TWR now shown as percentages; breakdown renamed from "Stock P&L Breakdown" to "P&L Breakdown" (includes funds and MMF)

### v0.16.3

- **`auth` subcommand group** — `longbridge auth login`, `auth logout`, `auth status`; `auth status` shows token validity, expiry, account info, and quote level locally without network
- **`alert enable` / `alert disable`** — toggle price alerts on/off without deleting them
- **Fix: US index symbols** — `.DJI.US`, `.VIX.US` and other US index symbols now parse correctly; US indexes require a leading dot (e.g. `.DJI.US`, not `DJI.US`)
- **"Did you mean?" hints** — when a query returns no data, the CLI suggests the correct symbol format: missing market suffix → `TSLA.US` / `700.HK`; missing leading dot → `.DJI.US`

### v0.16.1

**Enhancements**

- `option quote` — now returns all fields from the OptionQuote API (added `timestamp`, `trade_status`, `open_interest`, `historical_volatility`, `contract_multiplier`, `contract_size`, `direction`, `underlying_symbol`); JSON output uses proper typed values instead of table-column strings
- `calc-index` — Theta, Vega, and Rho values are now normalized (÷100) to standard per-share conventions; auto-detects option symbols and switches to Greeks default fields when stock defaults return empty
- `capital` — improved argument handling
- `market-status` — fixed incorrect `trade_status` mapping (105 = afternoon trading session); JSON output now returns human-readable market and status labels instead of raw API codes
- Parameter standardization: `--adjust none/forward` (was `no_adjust/forward_adjust`), `--tif day/gtc/gtd` (was `Day/GoodTilCanceled/GoodTilDate`), `--format table` as default name (alias: `pretty`), `finance-calendar --start/--end` (was `--date/--end-date`), `statement --start-date` now accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- TUI: fixed watchlist sort jumping and made scrollbar more subtle
