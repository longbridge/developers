```

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "current_period": "qf",
  "list": [
    {
      "details": [
        { "key": "revenue", "name": "Revenue", "estimate": "27144782630.0000", "is_released": false },
        { "key": "ebit", "name": "EBIT", "estimate": "1496709370.0000", "is_released": false }
      ]

Each `details` entry includes the metric key, the consensus estimate value, and whether the actual result has already been released. `current_index` in the full response indicates which period in the list is the current one.
