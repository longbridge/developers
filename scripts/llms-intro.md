# Longbridge Developers Documentation

Longbridge Developers provides programmatic quote trading interfaces for investors with research and development capabilities and assists them to build trading or quote strategy analysis tools based on their own investment strategies. The functions fall into the following categories:

- **Trading** - Create, amend, cancel orders, query today's/past orders and transaction details, etc.
- **Quotes** - Real-time quotes, acquisition of historical quotes, etc.
- **Portfolio** - Real-time query of the account assets, positions, funds
- **Real-time subscription** - Provides real-time quotes and push notifications for order status changes

## Interface Type

:::success

The [OpenAPI SDK](https://open.longbridge.com/sdk) has done effective frequency control internally:

- Quote: The methods under `QuoteContext` will be actively controlled by the SDK according to the server's rate limit. When the request is too fast, the SDK will automatically delay the request. Therefore, you do not need to implement the frequency control details separately.
- Trade: The methods under `TradeContext` are not limited by the SDK. Due to the special nature of the trading order placement scenario, this is left to the user to handle.
